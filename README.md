## Directions

### Step #1 - Make the array <br>

You're going to display your top 3 favorite fruits. To get started, make an array of them.
<br><br>
Remember: The fruit names are strings, so don't forget to write them between "quotation marks".
<br><br>
_Hint:_ 
<br>
`var XXX = [ " ", " ", " "]`
<br><br>
### Step #2 - Display them! <br>

Now, use the `text()` command to display each item on a different line, so that they're not overlapping.
<br><br>
_Hint:_ 
<br>
`fill(, , );`<br>
`text(, , );`<br>
`text(, , );`<br>
`text(, , );`

### Step #3 - Show the length! <br>

Now display a header that says 'My top 3 favorite fruits', anywhere!
<br><br>
_Hint:_ 
<br>
`text("My top " +  XXX.length + " favorite fruits", XPOS, YPOS );`
